### Using the fixtures dir


*The "fixtures" dir is the only place where you scripts in the "tests" dir can load files from.

Initially, your "tests" and "fixtures" dirs are here:


```
"$HOME/.r2g/temp/project/node_modules/X/.r2g/{fixtures,tests}"
```

they will be copied to:

```
"$HOME/.r2g/temp/project/fixtures"
"$HOME/.r2g/temp/project/tests"
```

The all the files in the tests dir will be executed directly, and those tests
may load files from the fixtures dir.
